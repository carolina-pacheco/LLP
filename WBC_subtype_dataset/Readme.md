Data files corresponding to train, validation and test sets can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kz9mU-Z3s-8nox8d79iLwk3BspESjPs8?usp=drive_link).

Three subtypes of white blood cells (WBCs) are modeled. Namely lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. Based on geometric and optical features, all three classes of cells are modeled as ellipsoids, with lymphocytes and monocytes having one ellipsoidal nucleus, and granulocytes having four spherical nuclei.
